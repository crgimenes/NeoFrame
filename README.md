# NeoFrame

## Overview

NeoFrame is a tool that creates an invisible floating window across the entire screen. This allows users to draw graphics via terminal commands reminiscent of the BASIC programs used on 8-bit microcomputers in the 1980s. Ideal for enhancing presentations, NeoFrame lets you illustrate your points directly in the terminal, even in full-screen mode.
