# NeoFrame

**Attention: This project is in early development and is not yet ready for use.**

## Overview

NeoFrame is a tool that creates an invisible floating window across the entire screen. This allows users to draw graphics via terminal commands reminiscent of the BASIC programs used on 8-bit microcomputers in the 1980s. Ideal for enhancing presentations, NeoFrame lets you illustrate your points directly in the terminal.

## Development environment

If you're a Nix user, you can simply enter the development environment with

```nix
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

The Nix build part will still be done later.
